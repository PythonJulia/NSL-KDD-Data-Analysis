# NSL-KDD-Data-Analysis
NSL-KDD (for network-based intrusion detection systems (IDS)) is a dataset suggested to solve some of the inherent problems of the parent KDD'99 dataset. This IDS basically helps to determine security of systems and alarming when intrusion is noticed or detected. Choosing NSL-KDD provides insightful analysis using various machine learning algorithms for intrusion detection. Myself expecting to explore intuitive insights of intrusion detection and work on various machine learning algorithms that is reasonable to understand future instance of attacks and its types.

This Data Analysis is basically divided into three stages. 
1. Data Preprocessing 
2. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) 
3. Machine Learning Data Modeling
